## 🌍 Overview

GreenProof connects the entire food supply chain on a unified platform to track environmental impact from farm to the final consumer. The system creates a transparent ecosystem where:

**Key Stakeholders:**
- **Manufacturers** — Primary producers who create raw materials
- **Processors** — Transform raw materials into processed products
- **Transporters** — Move products between supply chain participants
- **Sellers** — Retail companies that sell to end consumers

Each transaction and transfer in the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain, with CO₂ emissions calculated and tokenized. Companies with better environmental performance earn more green tokens, creating a sustainable incentive model.

## Operating System Compatibility

GreenProof has been developed and tested with different levels of compatibility across operating systems:

### Windows

- **Fully supported and tested** on Windows 11
- Complete functionality is available
- Recommended platform for production use
- All installation steps in this documentation are verified on Windows 11

### Linux

- **Basic support available** with limited testing
- May require additional configuration in some environments
- Known limitations:
  - Some Docker networking features may need manual configuration
  - Performance may vary depending on distribution

### macOS

- **Not officially supported**
- The application was not designed or tested to run on macOS
- Users may encounter unexpected issues if attempting to deploy on macOS
- No official troubleshooting support is available for macOS-specific problems

For the best experience and stability, we recommend deploying GreenProof on Windows 11.

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```ini
# Blockchain Configuration
PRIVATE_KEY="the_first_key_of_the_first_account_in_the_genesis_file_in_QBFT-Network"

# Database Configuration
SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
SUPABASE_KEY="your_supabase_key"

# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER="notification_email_address"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="notification_email_password(preferred email app password)"

# Application Configuration
WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN = "True"
SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
```
### Database Schema

<p align="center">
  <img src="/app/static/images/database_schema.png" alt="GreenProof Platform" width="800">
</p>

### Database Setup

1. Create a Supabase project from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.io/)
2. Import the database schema using one of these methods:
   - **Option A**: Using the command line (if you have PostgreSQL client installed):
     ```bash
     psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -U postgres -f database/schema.sql
     ```
   - **Option B**: Using the Supabase interface:
     1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
     2. Create a new query
     3. Copy and paste the entire content of [schema.sql](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file
     4. Execute the query
3. Configure the connection in your [.env](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) file with your Supabase credentials

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Wait for Docker container** to be ready


2. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Access the web interface** at `http://localhost:5000`

### User Roles

- **Admin**: Approve new companies, manage system settings
- **Company Admin**: Manage company profile, view emissions, trade tokens
- **Company User**: Input data, view company emissions

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Data Validation

All inputs are validated before being processed:
- Emission data is verified against industry standards
- User inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Implemented email-based MFA for enhanced account security
- Requires users to verify their identity via a code sent to their registered email address during login

### Sensitive Data Encryption

- Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) is encrypted at rest in the database
- Utilizes industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect data confidentiality

### Log-User Action

- Comprehensive logging of user actions for auditing and security monitoring
- Logs include timestamps, user IDs, action types, and affected data

### Password Recovery

- Secure password recovery process using email verification
- Prevents unauthorized access to accounts during password resets

### Login Attempt Limiting

- Implemented rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks
- Accounts are temporarily locked after a certain number of failed login attempts

### Unique Sessions

- Enforces unique user sessions to prevent session hijacking
- Each user can only have one active session at a time

### Robust Password Policies

- Enforces strong password policies to ensure password complexity
- Requires passwords to meet minimum length, character type, and complexity requirements

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Smart contract deployment fails**
   - Ensure Docker is running and accessible

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify your Supabase credentials
   - Check network connectivity to Supabase server

3. **Token transfer issues**
   - Ensure MetaMask is connected to the correct network
   - Verify the sender has sufficient token balance
